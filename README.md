# Metro Bus Route Finder using Weighted Graph, Dijkstra, BFS and DFS

A C++ DSA project that models the Lahore Metro Bus System as an undirected weighted graph. Each station is a vertex, and each route between two stations is a bidirectional weighted edge. The project demonstrates graph representation, Dijkstra's Algorithm, BFS traversal, DFS traversal, file handling, STL containers, recursion, and object-oriented programming.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a route finder for a metro bus network. The C++ system allows users to add stations, connect stations with distance weights, save/load route data, display the graph, find the minimum-distance route using Dijkstra's Algorithm, find the fewest-stops route using BFS, and perform a full DFS traversal of the metro network.

This project is suitable for a DSA course submission because it connects a real-world transport problem with core graph concepts.

## File Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.cpp` | Menu-driven console interface and user input handling |
| `Graph.h` | Graph class declaration |
| `Graph.cpp` | Graph class implementation, BFS, DFS, file handling, display logic |
| `stations.txt` | Persistent metro station and route data |
| `gui/` | Separate AI-generated GUI bonus interface |
| `README.md` | Complete project report and documentation |

The compiled executable is intentionally not included in the repository. Build outputs such as `metro.exe` should be regenerated locally.

## Graph Representation

The project stores the metro network using one weighted adjacency list:

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::pair<std::string, int>>> weightedAdjList;
```

Each key is a station name. Each value is a list of connected stations with their route weight.

Example:

```text
Shahdara -> Niazi Chowk(2200)
Niazi Chowk -> Shahdara(2200), Timber Market(560)
```

The graph is undirected. When a route is added from station `A` to station `B`, the program stores both:

```text
A -> B
B -> A
```

## Dataset Note

The default `stations.txt` dataset uses the Lahore Metrobus corridor from Shahdara to Gajjumata. Route weights are stored as approximate station-to-station distances in meters, based on publicly listed Lahore Metrobus station distance information and normalized to the 27 km corridor length. These values are realistic enough for Dijkstra-based route calculation, but they should be replaced with official GIS/survey data before using the project in a real transport system.

## File Format

The project uses `stations.txt` as persistent storage.

Supported formats:

```text
Station1,Station2,Weight
Standalone Station
```

Examples:

```text
Shahdara,Niazi Chowk,2200
Niazi Chowk,Timber Market,560
Isolated Station
```

Weights are stored as integer meters. For example, `2200` means `2.2 km`. Older two-column route lines such as `Station1,Station2` can still be loaded and are treated as weight `1`. New saves use the three-column weighted format. Invalid weights such as `0`, negative values, or non-numeric values are skipped during loading.

## Dijkstra Explanation

Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the route with the minimum total distance.

Steps:

1. Set all station distances to infinity.
2. Set the start station distance to `0`.
3. Use a priority queue to always process the station with the smallest known distance.
4. Relax each neighboring edge by checking whether a shorter distance was found.
5. Store each station's parent for path reconstruction.
6. Stop when the destination is reached.
7. Reconstruct the final minimum-distance route.

## BFS Explanation

BFS is used to find the route with the fewest number of station stops.

Steps:

1. Start from the source station.
2. Push the source station into a queue.
3. Mark it as visited.
4. Visit neighboring stations level by level.
5. Store each station's parent.
6. Stop when the destination is found.
7. Reconstruct the path using the parent map.

Important note: BFS reads neighbors from the weighted graph, but it does not compare weight values. It finds the route with the fewest station-to-station hops. Dijkstra's Algorithm is used when the user wants the minimum-distance route.

## DFS Explanation

DFS is used to traverse the graph deeply using recursion.

Steps:

1. Start from an unvisited station.
2. Mark it as visited.
3. Recursively visit each unvisited neighbor.
4. Continue until no unvisited neighbor remains.
5. If disconnected components exist, start DFS again from the next unvisited station.

The implementation covers disconnected graphs by looping over every station in the weighted adjacency list.

## Validation and Safety

The project includes the following checks:

- Empty station names are rejected.
- Whitespace around user input is removed.
- Duplicate stations are rejected.
- Duplicate routes are not inserted again.
- Existing weighted routes can be updated.
- Self-routes are rejected.
- Missing stations are rejected during manual route creation.
- Invalid file weights are skipped.
- BFS safely handles missing, isolated, same-source-destination, and unreachable station cases.
- DFS uses visited tracking to avoid infinite recursion in cyclic graphs.

## Complexity Analysis

Let:

- `V` = number of stations
- `E` = number of routes
- `d` = degree of a station

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Add station | O(1) average | O(1) | Uses `unordered_map` |
| Check station | O(1) average | O(1) | Uses `unordered_map::find` |
| Add weighted route | O(d) | O(1) | Vector scan prevents duplicate neighbors |
| Dijkstra shortest route | O((V + E) log V) | O(V) | Finds minimum-distance route |
| BFS fewest stops route | O(V + E) | O(V) | Finds shortest path by hop count |
| DFS traversal | O(V + E) | O(V) | Includes recursion stack |
| Load file | O(E * d) practical | O(V + E) | Each route checks for duplicates |
| Save file | O(E log E) | O(E) | Uses `set` to keep saved routes unique |
| Display map | O(V log V + E) | O(V) | Stations are sorted before display |

## How to Compile and Run

Compile:

```bash
g++ main.cpp Graph.cpp -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o metro.exe
```

Run on Windows:

```bash
metro.exe
```

Run on Linux/macOS:

```bash
./metro
```

## Separate GUI Bonus

The project also includes a separate AI-generated GUI in the `gui/` folder. It is not required for the core DSA viva, but it makes the project look more realistic.

Open this file in a browser:

```text
gui/index.html
```

The GUI includes:

- station dropdowns
- shortest-distance mode using Dijkstra
- fewest-stops mode using BFS
- route line visualization
- total distance in kilometers
- segment distance table

For viva, you can clearly say: the C++ code is the main DSA implementation, while the `gui/` folder is an AI-generated bonus interface.

## Example Dijkstra Output

```text
Shortest weighted route (27 stations, 27000 meters): Shahdara -> Niazi Chowk -> Timber Market -> Azadi Chowk -> Bhatti Chowk -> Katchery -> Civil Secretariat -> MAO College -> Janazgah -> Qartaba Chowk -> Shama -> Ichhra -> Canal -> Qaddafi Stadium -> Kalma Chowk -> Model Town -> Naseerabad -> Ittefaq Hospital -> Qainchi -> Ghazi Chowk -> Chungi Amar Sidhu -> Kamahan -> Atari Saroba -> Nishtar Colony -> Youhanabad -> Dulu Khurd -> Gajjumata
Dijkstra execution time: 1 ms
```

## Example DFS Output

```text
DFS traversal: Shahdara -> Niazi Chowk -> Timber Market -> Azadi Chowk -> Bhatti Chowk -> Katchery -> Civil Secretariat -> MAO College -> Janazgah -> Qartaba Chowk -> Shama -> Ichhra -> Canal -> Qaddafi Stadium -> Kalma Chowk -> Model Town -> Naseerabad -> Ittefaq Hospital -> Qainchi -> Ghazi Chowk -> Chungi Amar Sidhu -> Kamahan -> Atari Saroba -> Nishtar Colony -> Youhanabad -> Dulu Khurd -> Gajjumata
DFS execution time: 0 ms
```

## Strengths

- Clear graph-based modeling of a real transport system.
- Correct undirected route insertion.
- Correct Dijkstra logic for minimum-distance route finding.
- Correct BFS route logic for minimum hop count.
- Correct DFS traversal with disconnected graph coverage.
- Persistent storage through file handling.
- Duplicate route prevention.
- Single weighted adjacency list used across the graph.
- Realistic station-to-station distance weights in meters.
- Modular structure with separate header and implementation files.

## Current Limitations

- DFS is recursive, so extremely large graphs could risk stack overflow.
- Route insertion uses vectors, so duplicate checks are linear in station degree.
- There is no route deletion feature.
- There is no case-insensitive station matching.
- The console UI is simple and text-based.

## Future Improvements

- Add Prim's or Kruskal's Algorithm to demonstrate minimum spanning tree concepts.
- Add route deletion and station deletion.
- Add case-insensitive search.
- Add station suggestions for misspelled names.
- Store latitude/longitude data for real map visualization.
- Replace vector neighbor lists with `unordered_set` for faster duplicate checks.
- Add unit tests for BFS, DFS, file parsing, duplicate routes, and invalid input.

## Final Summary

This project successfully demonstrates how a metro bus route network can be represented using graph data structures in C++. It implements station and route management, persistent file storage, Dijkstra minimum-distance search, BFS fewest-stops search, DFS traversal, duplicate prevention, basic validation, and a separate GUI bonus interface.
